        <p>Purpose of this experiment is to explore how I can take a Strava route and check this against a list of locations e.g. hills, cafes etc to see which locations were visited on the route. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Black dots represent potentially thousands of location records in the database
            </li>
            <li>Red dots represent locations that are within the bounding box of the route - when querying the database we would filter so that only these locations that are within the bounding box will be compared against the route</li>
            <li>Green dots indicate dots that have been matched to the route (noting that we also apply a buffer to account for gps inaccuracy)</li>
